# [Project 1: Cyclistic: Projec Overview](https://github.com/sommyl/Sophie-Portfolio/)
* Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members for a bikeshare company in Chicago

## Code Used
**SQL Github:** https://github.com/sommyl/Sophie-Portfolio/blob/main/Cyclistic.sql
**Tableau:** https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sophie.liu3966/viz/Cyclistic_16450573041030/Story1

## Data Cleaning
I merged 12 CSV files containing trip information for past 12 months and made the following changes:

*	Created new columns for ride length and day of the week
*	Removed rows with ride length less than 10 minutes
*	Removed rows with nil latittude and longtitude

## EDA & Visualisation 
* Number of trips and average ride length per month, day of the week and each hour during the day  
* Geographic concetration of starting station and end station

## Recommendation
* In order to achieve maximum reach of casual riders, it is recommended that advertisement is to be placed  **during summer season** (monthly trend), **on the weekend** (day of the week), **from 12pm to 5pm** (hour of the day) and **in Harbour and Millennium Park area** (geographic concentration).
* In relation to the observation that casuals take longer rides than annual member, the company could use some form of communication as prompt at the end of each ride to recognise it as a milestone in order to entice future rides with more likelihood for member subscription.
