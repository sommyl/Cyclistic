# [Project 1: Cyclistic: Projec Overview](https://github.com/sommyl/Sophie-Portfolio/)
* Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members for a bikeshare company in Chicago

## Code Used
**SQL Github:** https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium  
**Tableau:** https://towardsdatascience.com/selenium-tutorial-scraping-glassdoor-com-in-10-minutes-3d0915c6d905  

## Data Cleaning
I merged 12 CSV files containing trip information for past 12 months and made the following changes:

*	Created new columns for ride length and day of the week
*	Removed rows with ride length less than 10 minutes
*	Removed rows with nil latittude and longtitude

## EDA & Visualisation 
* Number of trips and average ride length per month, day of the week and each hour during the day  
* Geographic concetration of starting station and end station

## Recommendation
* In order to achieve maximum reach of casual riders, it is recommended that advertisement is to be placed  **during summer season** (monthly trend), **on the weekend** (day of the week), **from 12pm to 5pm** (hour of the day) and **in Harbour and Millennium Park area** (geographic concentration).
